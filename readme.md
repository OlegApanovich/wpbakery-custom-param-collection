## Description

This is a collection of additional custom elements parameters for [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wpbakery.com/) wordpress plugin.
By default, WPBakery already has a lot of [pre-defined element parameters](https://kb.wpbakery.com/docs/inner-api/vc_map/#vc_map()-paramsArray), but if you need even more customization with your WPBakery editor element, this is a great collection of additional element params for it.

## How to install

### 1. As a regular WordPress plugin.

Clone this repo to your wp-content/plugin folder of your wordpress project.
git clone 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:OlegApanovich/wpbakery-custom-param-collection.git
Then go to wordpress dashboard plugins section, and activate the newly installed plugin here.
That's it. Now you can specify any custom parameters from the list below in your custom WPBakery element, and they appear in your element edit popup.
